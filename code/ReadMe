------------Solr--------------------
System used: Virtual Box Ubuntu 18, 10gb ram, 4 cpu cores
Port used: 8983, 7574, 9983
Collection: "metamapData" is the ontology given and "allData" is the scrapping data (converted to .csv)
Run: "solr_setup.sh" script to start solr and "solr_stop.sh" script to stop solr. Solr needs to be running for the code to work

More Detail about Solr:
# With this setup, each indexing take under 10 secs. 
# If want to increase nodes/shard for better performance. run "solr_stop.sh" script and use "bin/solr start -e cloud" and ignore the first 2 setup session

# creating solr cloud on port 8983 and 7574 using example/cloud/node.. setup
    bin/solr start -c -p 8983 -s example/cloud/node1/solr
    bin/solr start -c -p 7574 -s example/cloud/node2/solr -z localhost:9983
    
# creating 2 collection: metamapData, metamapData with 2 solr node with 2 shards
    bin/solr create -c metamapData -s 2 -rf 2
    bin/solr create -c allData -s 2 -rf 2

# add whole text search field, not recommend for very very large data
# by default, search format is category:keyword  (e.g. symptom:cough)
# adding this will allow full text searching without category (e.g. cough)
    curl -X POST -H 'Content-type:application/json' --data-binary '{"add-copy-field" : {"source":"*","dest":"_text_"}}' http://localhost:8983/solr/metamapData/schema
    curl -X POST -H 'Content-type:application/json' --data-binary '{"add-copy-field" : {"source":"*","dest":"_text_"}}' http://localhost:8983/solr/allData/schema

# indexing the data and store them in collection
# my data is in solr-8.8.1/example/MetamapResult.csv and solr-8.8.1/example/stage1_scrapping.csv
    bin/post -c metamapData example/MetamapResult.csv
    bin/post -c allData example/stage1_scrapping.csv

# solr comes with a Gui, you can view your collection in your web browser with these links:
# you can find the new query link pattern by using the GUI. Use the "q" session right under common (e.g *:* is search for all data)
    http://localhost:8983/solr/#/allData/query
    http://localhost:8983/solr/#/metamapData/query


# Deleting collection
    bin/solr delete -c allData 
    bin/solr delete -c metamapData
    bin/solr stop -all

----------------Coding--------------------------

The search_request script consists of three queries involving Solr.
    Query 1: Given a search term, return posts in order of relevance
    Query 2: Given a post number, return related symptoms/treatments/drugs/body parts
    Query 3: Given a post URL, return the original post, replies, and subreplies

Below are the steps in which the user interface would use these queries:
    1. The user inputs a search term and clicks a button to submit
    2. The results of query 2 are presented to the user as optional filters
    3. The results of query 3 are presented as the final search results
